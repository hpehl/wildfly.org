      <h2>Powerful</h2>
      <p><strong>Configuration in WildFly is centralized, simple and user-focused.</strong> The configuration file is organized by subsystems that you can easily comprehend and no internal server wiring is exposed. All management capabilities are exposed in a unified manner across many forms of access. These include a CLI, a web based administration console, a native Java API, an HTTP/JSON based REST API, and a JMX gateway. These options allow for custom automation using the tools and languages that best fit your needs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="callout yellow tablet-fullwidth">
      <h2>Modular</h2>
      <p><strong>WildFly does classloading right.</strong> It uses JBoss Modules to provide true application isolation, hiding server implementation classes from the application and only linking with JARs your application needs. Visibility rules have sensible defaults, yet can be customized. The dependency resolution algorithm means that classloading performance is not affected by the number of versions of libraries you have installed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="callout teal tablet-fullwidth">
      <h2>Lightweight</h2>
      <p><strong>WildFly takes an aggressive approach to memory management.</strong> The base runtime services were developed to minimize heap allocation by using common cached indexed metadata over duplicate full parses, which reduces heap and object churn. The administration console is 100% stateless and purely client driven. It starts instantly and requires zero memory on the server. These optimizations combined enable WildFly to run with stock JVM settings and also on small devices while leaving more headroom for application data and supports higher scalability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="callout orange tablet-fullwidth">
      <h2>Standards Based</h2>
      <p><strong>WildFly implements the latest in enterprise Java standards from Jakarta EE and Eclipse MicroProfile.</strong> These improve developer productivity by providing rich enterprise capabilities in easy to consume frameworks that eliminate boilerplate and reduce technical burden. This allows your team to focus on the core business needs of your application. By building your application on standards you retain the flexibility to migrate between various vendor solutions.</p>

          <p>We are almost at the end of 2024 and we wanted to take this opportunity to thank all our community members for their help on WildFly this year. 2024 was a busy year for WildFly and a lot was accomplished. We continued with our quarterly releases and delivered 4 Major versions (31, 32, 33, 34) and 5 micro updates. WildFly 35 Beta also just came out last week.

          <p>In this blog post I&#8217;d like to show how you can use the management console (aka HAL) for WildFly instances running on OpenShift. Prerequisites The console is an integral part of WildFly and is activated by default when running on-premise. For instances running on OpenShift, the console is not available by default, though. To use the console on OpenShift, you need a WildFly image that meets the following requirements: Management user: The management console is...</p>

This feature pack introduces Vertx configuration capabilities through the WildFly management model, making it easier to manage and integrate Vertx with existing WildFly subsystems. Note In the 35 release, the vertx subsystem is only available in WildFly Preview, and not in standard WildFly.
