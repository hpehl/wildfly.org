In this guide, you will learn how to use logging in your application and configure WildFly to
display the logs at the level you want.

include::{includedir}/_prerequisites.adoc[]

To use logging in our application, we will add a dependency on `org.jboss.logging:jboss-logging` in the Maven `pom.xml` file.
Then, we will add a few logs in our code at different levels.
Finally, we will configure WildFly to change the log level of our application logs independently of WildFly own logs.

== Add Dependency on JBoss Logging

In order to use JBoss Logging in our application, we need to add a dependency on it in the `pom.xml`.

The dependency is defined as:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.jboss.logging</groupId>
    <artifactId>jboss-logging</artifactId>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----

You need to add it to the `<dependencies>` section of the `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    ...
    <!-- copy the dependency here -->
</dependencies>
----

== Add Logging to the Application

As an example, you can update the `GettingStartedService.java` file to add logging to the application at different levels:

[source,java]
----
package org.wildfly.examples;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.jboss.logging.Logger;

@ApplicationScoped
public class GettingStartedService {

    private static Logger log = Logger.getLogger(GettingStartedService.class.getName());

    public String hello(String name) {
        log.trace("called method with: {}", name);
        String out = String.format("Hello '%s'.", name);
        log.info("returning: " + out);
        return out;
    }
}
----

You added a `log` Logger that can log message with the category corresponding to the class package `org.wildfly.examples`.
You also added two logging calls, one at the `TRACE` level and the other one at the `INFO` level.

If you run the integration tests with `mvn clean verify`, you will only see the logs at the `INFO` level in the standard output:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean verify
...
15:18:08,482 INFO  [org.wildfly.examples.GettingStartedService] (default task-1) returning: Hello 'World'.
...
----

By default, WildFly only displays `INFO` logs on the console.
Let's now configure WildFly to display our application logs at the `TRACE` level.

== Configure Logging in the WildFly Subsystem

The configuration of logging is done by WildFly in its `logging` subsystem.
There are different ways to modify the WildFly configuration but as we used the `wildfly-maven-plugin` to provision WildFly,
we can pass a CLI script so the WildFly configuration will be modified whenever we invoke `mvn package`.

First, we add a `configuration.cli` in the `src/main/scripts` directory:

[source]
----
# let the console display TRACE logs
/subsystem=logging/console-handler=CONSOLE:write-attribute(name=level, value=TRACE)
# create the logger for our code (with the category org.wildfly.examples corresponding to our package)
/subsystem=logging/logger=org.wildfly.examples:add(level=TRACE)
----

This script contains the management operations to change the WildFly configuration. We could invoke any management operations but, in this case, we only modify the `/subsystem=logging` resources that control the logging aspects.

You then need to modify the `wildfly-maven-plugin` configuration in `pom.xml` to execute this:

Copy the XML snippet:

[source,xml]
----
<packaging-scripts>
    <packaging-script>
        <scripts>
            <script>${project.build.scriptSourceDirectory}/configuration.cli</script>
        </scripts>
    </packaging-script>
</packaging-scripts>
----

And add it to the `<configuration>` section of the `wildfly-maven-plugin`:

[source]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>wildfly-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${version.wildfly.maven.plugin}</version>
    <configuration>
        ...
        <!-- copy the XML snippet here -->
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

With that change in place, if you provision WildFly and run the integration tests again, both log calls are now displayed:

[source]
----
$ mvn clean verify

...
16:04:22,260 TRACE [org.wildfly.examples.GettingStartedService] (default task-2) called method with: World
16:04:22,260 INFO  [org.wildfly.examples.GettingStartedService] (default task-2) returning: Hello 'World'.
...
----
